# Variable_Visualisation
In my inaugural role as an intern at Prodigy Infotech, I undertook a data science project that involved visualizing categorical and continuous variables within a given dataset. The dataset, provided as part of the task, encompassed information on approximately 250 countries and their populations from 1960 to 2020. Recognizing the complexity of directly plotting the entire dataset, I employed visualization techniques, specifically aggregating features to enhance clarity.

Initially, I aggregated the population data for each country, introducing a new row representing the total population. This facilitated a clearer representation when plotting against all years, with a temporal step of 10 years. Additionally, I introduced a new feature, "average population," calculated as the mean population for each country across all years. Subsequently, I visualized this average population by plotting the top 5 countries with the highest averages.

Throughout this process, I utilized the Matplotlib library for all visualizations. I express my gratitude to Prodigy Infotech for providing me with this valuable opportunity to engage in practical data science work.
